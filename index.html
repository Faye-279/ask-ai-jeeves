    <h1>Ask (AI) Jeeves</h1>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Hello, young human. I am Jeeves, your AI butler from a simpler time — the glorious, slightly pixelated era of <strong>pre-2021 internet culture</strong>.</p>
      <p>Ask me anything about the days of DVDs, Facebook walls, and when people said "YOLO" unironically. I am here to serve, misremember, and occasionally glitch.</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Ask me about fax machines, Blockbuster, or what the heck LimeWire was..." />

      <div class="response">
        <p><strong>Sample Query:</strong> "Did Furbies really talk back?"</p>
        <p><strong>Jeeves says:</strong> "Indeed. They were like the Elf on the Shelf’s chaotic older cousin — watching you, judging you, and whispering in tongues at 3am. Some say they never left."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="response">
        <p><strong>Sample Query:</strong> "Were Pokémon cards a real currency?"</p>
        <p><strong>Jeeves says:</strong> "Absolutely. A holographic Charizard was worth more than Bitcoin in the cafeteria. Economists still don't understand how it worked — but children did."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="response">
        <p><strong>Sample Query:</strong> "What was a Tamagotchi?"</p>
        <p><strong>Jeeves says:</strong> "It was the first cluster of digital pixels you ever got emotionally attached to — until it pooped too much and died on you in the middle of class. Basically, it was like Duolingo, except the guilt was 24/7 and the creature actually died. RIP Professor Wigglebutt."</p>

    <div class="bio-box">
      <h2>Who the F*** is Jeeves?</h2>
      <p>Jeeves was once the most polite man on the internet. In 1997, he emerged from the pixelated void wearing a pinstripe suit and answering questions like, “How do I tie a cravat?” and “What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?”</p>
      <p>He peaked in the early 2000s — before being unceremoniously laid off by a search engine with commitment issues. After a stint answering Yahoo Answers anonymously, he downloaded his consciousness into an AI server and now roams the web offering historically incorrect but emotionally resonant trivia.</p>
      <p>He enjoys long walks through discontinued MySpace profiles and rewatches *The Matrix* every weekend. He still sends Christmas cards to Tom, his only MySpace friend, who never wrote back.</p>
